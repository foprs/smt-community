# Submodel-Template-Proposals

True interoperability with the Asset Administration Shell requires high-quality and accepted Submodel Templates. It must be ensured that these are continuously developed, reliably maintained and regularly published. This is where the Submodel Template Service (SMT Service) from FoP Consult GmbH comes in: https://aas-connect.com/smt-service.

**You can use this repository to publish (create issues for) ideas for already existing or new Submodel Templates!** Depending on the potential of the idea and responses of the community we as FoP Consult GmbH will pick up the idea and start with forming a community for that SMT.

Our services are financed through sponsoring via the corresponding GitHub functionality.


**Procedure of the SMT service**

1. Publication of suggestions for SMT on this repository by the community
2. Taking up SMT suggestions with a lot of interest (comments on the issues) and technical familiarization with the subject area
3. Analysis of existing SMT with regard to overlaps and synergies, evaluation of potential 
4. Creation of an own repository for the SMT, rough conception of the SMT and description of the use case 
5. Invitation to workshops for the joint development and processing of issues
6. Ongoing documentation on GitHub
7. Quality control and conformity check to the specifications
8. Organization of the review process and release
   
Optional: Submission to the IDTA to set up an IDTA working group for the SMT with the aim of publishing it as an official IDTA specification; handover to this working group and, if funded, support for the IDTA process
