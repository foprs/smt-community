# Submodel-Template-Proposals

True interoperability with the Asset Administration Shell requires high-quality and accepted Submodel Templates. It must be ensured that these are continuously developed, reliably maintained and regularly published. This is where the Submodel Template Service (SMT Service) from FoP Consult GmbH comes in: https://aas-connect.com/smt-service.

**You can use this repository to create issues with ideas for already existing or new Submodel Templates!** Depending on the potential of the idea and responses of the community we as FoP Consult GmbH will pick up the idea and start with forming a community for that SMT to which we offer our services.
