# AAS-connect Submodel Template Community
True interoperability with the Asset Administration Shell requires high-quality and by a broad community used Submodel Templates. There are many use cases for the AAS and not every 'thinkable' SMT can be probably provided by IDTA. This is where our **open** Submodel Template Community comes into the game.  

We are picking new ideas for SMT from the **issue list of this repo** and are organizing development workshops for SMT. This includes a thorough preparation and moderation of each workshop as well as documentation of the results as SMT specification here on GitHub in order to lead the community of experts to be able to present a new improved version after every workshop. Every SMT will get its own repository on GitHub with an own issue list, documentation and releases. The SMT will be published with a CC-BY-4.0 license.  

We are following all relevant AAS specifications, ensure the application of best practices and established standards. Where appropriate SMT can be developed also as Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) in a first step.
The FoP Consult GmbH has extensive experiences in AAS modeling and can thus support the community with architecture and design decisions.

To take part on the workshops and to influence the outcome booking of the meetings is necessary.

**You can use this repository to publish (create issues for) ideas for new Submodel Templates!** Depending on the potential of the idea and responses of the community we as FoP Consult GmbH will pick up the idea, start with workshop preparations and will publish the booking-link above.
